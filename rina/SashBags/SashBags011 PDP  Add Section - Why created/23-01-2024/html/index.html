                <h2>Why the Sash Bag was Created</h2>
                <p>"I was at an amusement park with my five-year old son and was so frustrated with my purse that I put it back in the car, but then I didn’t have enough room in my pockets for the things I needed. I wanted something that was not a purse, but still allowed me to magically have everything I need at my fingertips. I couldn’t find a good solution and then, the idea for a Sash Bag just popped into my head! So, I made one and after three people stopped and asked me where I got it, I knew I was on to something that could be big. Needless to say, I haven’t carried a “purse” in 13 years!"</p>
