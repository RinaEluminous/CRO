                    <h2>What is a Consumer Proposal?</h2>
                    <p>A consumer proposal is a renegotiation of what you owe to your creditors, handled by
                        Bromwich+Smith on your behalf. You pay what you can afford, instead of what your creditors were
                        demanding. (Usually eliminating debt for only a percentage of original amount owed). Think of it
                        as a settlement with those you owe on terms you both agree with.</p>

                        <p>A consolidated loan does not have a negative impact on your credit rating, while a consumer
                            proposal will. However, a consolidation loan will result in you paying back significantly
                            more than the amount you are owing today because of the application of interest, whereas a
                            Consumer Proposal typically allows you to pay back only a percentage of what you owe today,
                            with no interest. Further, a consolidation loan will require that you pledge assets and/or
                            obtain co-signers for the loan, while no such requirements are needed for a Consumer

                            Doing this adds unnecessary stress and time to the process. If you give away your assets or
                            sell them for less than fair market value, your creditors can reclaim them through a court
