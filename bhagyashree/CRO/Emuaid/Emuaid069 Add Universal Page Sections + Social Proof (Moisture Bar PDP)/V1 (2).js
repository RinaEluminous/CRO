            <p>EMUAID® Therapeutic Moisture Bar is a perfect complement to EMUAID® First Aid Ointment for pain and discomfort relief from dermatitis, eczema, psoriasis, and rosacea. The natural soap bar contains nature’s most effective anti-bacterial and anti-fungal essential oils that deliver intense hydration and stimulate natural skin regeneration.
